Solving a Sudoku with Recursion


# How it works: 
You fill out a grid that represents the puzzle, where 0 is a unknow field.
Something like: 
'''
grid = [[0,0,0,0,1,5,0,7,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,8,1],
        [3,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,2],
        [0,9,0,0,0,0,0,5,0],
        [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,7,6,0,0,0,0,1,0],
        [7,0,0,0,5,0,4,0,0],
        [0,4,5,3,0,0,7,0,8],
        [2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0]]
'''

# Then by running each steps you'll get an answer: 
Each 0 is replaced by the actial values


```

[[6 8 9 2 1 5 3 7 4]
 [4 2 7 9 3 6 5 8 1]
 [3 5 1 4 8 7 9 6 2]
 [1 9 4 6 2 3 8 5 7]
 [5 3 2 1 7 8 6 4 9]
 [8 7 6 5 4 9 2 1 3]
 [7 1 3 8 5 2 4 9 6]
 [9 4 5 3 6 1 7 2 8]
 [2 6 8 7 9 4 1 3 5]]
```
